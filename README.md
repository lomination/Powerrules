## DDNet rules writter with Scala 3

### Project description

The aim of this project is to make it easier to write rules by offering a new, easier and more powerful language.

It requires Scala 3. It is crosscompiled with JVM and Scala JS.

### Usage

You can try it [here](https://lomination.github.io/ddnettools/).

See [wiki](https://github.com/lomination/ddnettools/wiki).

You can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it with `sbt rootJVM/run`. By launching the compiled js, you can open a conerter from the new language to ddnet rules format.
