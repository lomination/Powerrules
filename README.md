## Powerrules

The Powerrules is a language that can generate DDNet rules language and aims to make it simpler to write rules by offering a new, easier and more powerful language.

You can use the [online transpiler](https://lomination.github.io/Powerrules/) to convert Powerrules into DDNet rules. See the [wiki](https://github.com/lomination/Powerrules/wiki) to learn more about writing Powerrules.
